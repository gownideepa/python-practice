Exclusion Product bookmark_borderYou are given an array of integers of size N. Create a new array such that the element at an index i in the new array is the product of all the elements of the original array except the element present at index i.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N - the size of the array. The second line contains N integers - the elements of the array.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the new array, separated by a new line. Since these numbers can be very large, print the numbers % 109 + 7

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= N <= 105
0 <= A[i] <= 105

Example:
Input
2
5
1 5 3 2 8
6
4 10 1 2 8 3

Output
240 48 80 120 30
480 192 1920 960 240 640

Explanation

Test-Case 1
The product of all elements of the array except for the element at index 0 is 5 * 3 * 2 * 8 = 240
The product of all elements of the array except for the element at index 1 is 1 * 3 * 2 * 8 = 48
The product of all elements of the array except for the element at index 2 is 1 * 5 * 2 * 8 = 80
The product of all elements of the array except for the element at index 3 is 1 * 5 * 3 * 8 = 120
The product of all elements of the array except for the element at index 4 is 1 * 5 * 3 * 2 = 30


Solution :







for _ in range(int(input())):
    n=int(input())
    arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
    m=(10**9)+7
    res=[1]*n
    l=1
    for i in range(n):
        res[i]=l
        l=(l*arr[i])%m 
    r=1

    for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
        res[i]=(res[i]*r)%m 
        r=(r*arr[i])%m 


    print(*res)
